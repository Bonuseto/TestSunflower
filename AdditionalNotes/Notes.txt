Features: 
	Search: "One way"
		"Return"
		"MultiCity"
		"NOMAD"
	Booking: "Booking one-way ticket for non-signed user"
	
Bugs: I didn't found any bugs, but I think UX for "NOMAD" search feature can be upgraded a little bit. I will attach video called "ux.mp4" which is 3 minutes long and showing what can be changed.

Time spent: "Search" - 3 minutes
			"Booking" - 2 minutes

Additional notes: I never userd Gherkin before, so I hope I used it correctly.
